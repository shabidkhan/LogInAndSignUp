# LogInAndSignUp
In this project, I made a simple LoginSignup app using [React](https://reactjs.org) library of JavaScript. In this app, I do have Login and Signup page with using express library of javaScript.

<h2>Requirements and Execution</h2>
If you're using Linux-based OS, open your terminal, and clone the app using the following command. <br>

`git clone https://github.com/shabidkhan/LogInAndSignUp.git`
<br>

Next, get into the project-directory, and type the following command to install necessary dependencies onto your system.
sudo npm install

Now, you're all set. Just write `npm start` to start your local server. <br>
Open your browser, and go to http://localhost:3000/ to play the game. <br>
